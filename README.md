*DESCRIPTION *: n this assignment, the goal was to build an interactive AI Chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The task was aimed at exploring the foundations of natural language understanding and implementing a system that can respond to user queries based on pre-programmed knowledge. This assignment required leveraging a popular NLP library — in this case, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) — to tokenize user input and match it against known questions and patterns.

Tools and Technologies Used
The primary tool used for this assignment was the Python programming language, an ideal choice for working with text data due to its simplicity, extensive libraries, and active developer community. To implement NLP capabilities, the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library was used. NLTK provides built-in methods for text processing, making it suitable for creating basic chatbots and extracting patterns from user inputs.

In this assignment:

The nltk.word_tokenize() method was used to break down user input into words for better understanding.

The bot used a dictionary (responses) as its knowledge base, mapping specific questions or keywords to pre-written answers.

An interactive command-line interface was implemented using Python’s built-in input() and print() methods.

Real-World Applications

Although this is a basic Chatbot, it demonstrates fundamental concepts that can be implemented in many practical scenarios:

1.Customer Support: Chatbots can answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) instantly, reducing wait times and supporting 24/7 service.

2.E-learning and Education: Chatbots can help students by responding to common questions about courses, schedules, or policies.

3.Healthcare: Chatbots can provide basic medical information and guide patients towards the right services.
